# Hello, World!

This blog website was set up using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).

I'm doing my graduation project using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), so over the course of 2.5 months, I became comfortable with it. When I wanted to make this blog, I first approached it by creating a folder to store [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/articles/markdown-basics) files, then using code to import them, parse them using [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked), and render the resulting HTML. VitePress can do that out of the box and has additional features like Vue in Markdown. It is used for documentation in Vue-related libraries such as Vue, [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/), and VitePress, which is why their documentation look almost the same.
