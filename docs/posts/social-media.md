# Social media

I barely use social media. I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. My university's interest clubs mainly use Instagram to announce their activities, so I would miss many of them. However, I don't care much about activities anyway. Social media that I use are WhatsApp, Signal, and Discord.

There are many what I like to call "infinite content generators" on the Internet. They are platforms to which users can upload content. They likely have so much content that you aren't able to read all of it in a lifetime. They aren't all social media. Wikipedia is an example.

At least for me, it's easy to go down the rabbit hole in infinite content generators. Some people blame recommendation algorithms. These are algorithms that predict your interests from your browsing history. When you read a social media post, the algorithm shows you another post that you're likely to be interested in, so you read the second post, and the third post, as so on. You can easily lose control over how much time you spend.

However, from my experience, you don't need a recommendation algorithm. Your brain can be one. My social media cravings are often triggered by feelings like "I wonder if there's anything new in that website lately" or "I want to re-experience that video". The first video invokes further feelings that make me watch the second video, then the third. I go down the rabbit hole with the search bar instead of recommended content.

I remember spending entire days reading the subreddit of the video game _Deltarune_, despite never having played it. I would sort by upvote count and read from the top. Eventually, when I reload the window, I needed to scroll down for several pages before I would see new content.

About 7 years ago, I deactivated my Facebook account and deleted social media apps from my phone in the midst of a mental health crisis. On my computer, I installed [Cold Turkey Blocker](https://getcoldturkey.com/), which blocks websites and prevents you from disabling or uninstalling it. My friends call it malware.

I used parental controls to disable my phone's browser and asked my parents to set a password for changing the controls. When I actually needed to use the browser, I asked my parents to enter the password in secret. My parents resisted, saying that I need to exercise self-control to avoid social media. I felt anger and despair, believing that self-control is a myth, that they're asking me to do the impossible. They still agreed to help, which is how I stayed away from social media for several years.

::: details You thought self-control is a myth?
Some people believe that willpower is a resource that can be used up. They suggest that modifying the environment is a more effective way to change your behaviour than relying on willpower. For example, if you want to eat fewer snacks, you can hide them. At that time, I took the advice to the extreme to say that self-control doesn't exist.

[The existence of willpower depletion is controversial](https://www.apa.org/topics/personality/willpower). It was first suggested in a 1998 study showing that subjects who resisted cookies spent less time on a puzzle afterwards before giving up. However, many researchers tried to repeat the study and couldn't replicate the finding.

Also, there are signs that [self-control and willpower are different](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/self-control-willpower-psychology). Willpower means acting against urges when they're in your face. Self-control includes willpower, but also strategies that prevent urges in the first place. For example, I've described many self-control attempts in this post. Researchers found that people skilled at self-control might not have more willpower, but they developed habits and felt weaker urges. That's the actual reason behind the "modify your environment" advice.

To summarise, here's a table generated by Gemini and adapted by me:

| Old view: Self-control as effort                                        | New view: Self-control as strategy                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| White-knuckling: Forcing yourself to study while your phone is buzzing. | Situation selection: Putting the phone in another room before you start. |
| Inhibition: Stopping an impulse if it starts.                           | Habit formation: Automating behaviors so they don't require a decision.  |
| Trait-based: Discipline is mostly innate.                               | Skill-based: Self-control is a suite of learnable techniques.            |

That couldn't last forever. What if I need the browser when my parents aren't beside me? Before I left for a semester-long university exchange programme, I removed the parental control password. I can still disable the browser, but re-enabling it is a few taps away. Since then, I relapsed every one week to one month.

A week ago, I binged social media for several days, sinking 26 hours in total. On the final day, after sinking 8 hours and 52 minutes, I desperately asked a chatbot for advice. Usually, their first response isn't so useful because they would give advice that you've tried and didn't work. So, I clarified to them why their advice didn't work.

The chatbot suggested on their third response that I keep a log. If I need the browser for a legitimate use, then I log the use. If I use the browser without logging beforehand, it's a relapse. I'll need to log what triggered the relapse, what I browsed, and how much time I spent. Once I implemented this, the urge to binge evokes thoughts about writing a relapse — "I spent 9 hours watching YouTube videos" — which deters me from bingeing. It's only been four days since I started logging, so I'm not confident that it works, but it's promising.
