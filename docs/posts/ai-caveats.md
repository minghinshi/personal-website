# Caveats of AI

## What do you mean by AI?

In colloquial usage, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to technology that does thinking-like things. This vague concept allows AI to be associated with technologies of a wide range of intelligence levels. For example:

- Spam email detection
- [The "algorithm"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) that recommends Instagram posts or YouTube videos
- [Speech-to-text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition), such as voice typing
- [Face recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system), may be used to unlock your phone
- [Image classification](https://huggingface.co/tasks/image-classification), teaching computers to see
- Game-playing bots like [Deep Blue](https://www.ibm.com/history/deep-blue) and [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.google/research/alphago/)
- Chatbots, from [simple rule-following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) to ChatGPT

::: details Same AI problem, different levels of intelligence
An easy way to make text-to-speech is to record the pronunciation of each word on a computer. Then, the computer can read text by playing the pronunciation of each word. However, it couldn't handle new words, which constantly appear in academic fields or Internet circles. It also couldn't convey meaning with [prosody](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)>), meaning that it lacks emotion. Recent AI models, such as those from [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/), are solving these problems. Intuitively, these models are more intelligent than a computer playing the pronunciation of words, showing that the same AI problem can be approached with varying levels of intelligence.

The bottom line: There are many types of AI and many kinds of intelligent behavior, so marketing can easily claim that a product has used AI. When you see "AI", then ask yourself, "Which type of AI?"

The product doesn't even need to include AI. "AI-powered" could only mean that AI was used in the product's design process, not that the product includes AI. And when so many of us rely on AI for work, it's not surprising that products are "AI-powered". I don't claim that this is the correct interpretation of "AI-powered". I claim that it's so vague, we need to stop ourselves from jumping to conclusions.

A new term called "[AI washing](https://www.google.com/search?q=AI+washing)" captures this phenomenon, analogous to "[greenwashing](https://www.britannica.com/money/greenwashing)" where companies exaggerate their sustainability efforts.
