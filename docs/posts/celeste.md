# Celeste

## Difficulty scales

::: info
This section is a work-in-progress.

Celeste presents itself as a difficult game. I took about 1h 30m and 200 deaths to beat the first level. 100 hours later, I took 12 hours and 5,000 deaths to beat the final level ("Farewell"). Most of the difference is due to length: Farewell is about 10 times as long as the first level, in terms of time required to complete the level. Still, notice that rate of progression in Farewell at 100 hours of experience ≈ rate of progression in level 1 at 0 hours of experience.

This only scratches the surface of how difficult Celeste can get.

While Farewell is difficult, players are more skilled. The game awards a golden strawberry ("golden" for short) for completing a level without dying. Many can complete Farewell golden at 150 hours of experience.

::: details Where did you get "150 hours" from?
I checked the play time of players who posted "Farewell golden" videos on the Celeste Steam community page. The mode seems to be ~150 hours. Community also says that ~100 hours is needed for Farewell golden, while ~60 hours is needed to beat Celeste without golden strawberries, which is ~160 hours in total.

As a result, the community created levels far harder than what the base game offers. Later, levels with a wide range of difficulties are all marked "much harder than Farewell". We needed a scale to tell them apart.

### Spring Collab

The modern difficulty scale began in [Spring Collab 2020](https://gamebanana.com/mods/150813), a level pack of more than 80 Celeste levels. Levels were sorted into 5 "lobbies" of increasing difficulty: <span class="difficulty-beg">beginner</span>, <span class="difficulty-int">intermediate</span>, <span class="difficulty-adv">advanced</span>, <span class="difficulty-exp">expert</span>, <span class="difficulty-gm">grandmaster</span>. Each lobby is further divided into green (low), yellow (mid), and red (high) sub-difficulties, so that players approaching a lobby can start with the green levels.

So far, we have 15 difficulty levels, from low beginner (1) to high grandmaster (15).

::: info
Farewell is often considered high intermediate (6) to low advanced (7).
:::

The two hardest grandmaster levels, "Ultra Difficult" and "Heart of the Storm", receive a special "cracked" sub-difficulty. It's because the meter showing the sub-difficulty has cracked. As we will see, it's controversial whether cracked grandmaster levels really are one difficulty level higher than red grandmaster levels.

Thanks to the popularity of Spring Collab, its difficulty scale became Celeste's de facto difficulty scale. When a level creator describes their level as "low expert" (10), players know it's comparable to low expert levels in Spring Collab. Spring Collab became a standard.

### Strawberry Jam

[Strawberry Jam](https://gamebanana.com/mods/424541), a level pack following the same structure as Spring Collab, was released three years later. Its levels span a wider range of difficulties. In particular, its grandmaster lobby features several levels harder than cracked grandmaster levels in Spring Collab. As a result, the difficulty scale was adjusted, roughly like this:

| Strawberry Jam       | Spring Collab                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Low advanced (7)     | Low advanced (7)                         |
| Mid advanced (8)     | Mid advanced (8)                         |
| High advanced (9)    | High advanced (9)<br>Low expert (10)     |
| Low expert (10)      | Mid expert (11)                          |
| Mid expert (11)      | High expert (12)<br>Low grandmaster (13) |
| High expert (12)     | Mid grandmaster (14)                     |
| Low grandmaster (13) | High grandmaster (15)                    |
| Mid grandmaster (14) | Cracked grandmaster (?)                  |

::: details Where did you get this mapping from?
There's no official mapping. These are my opinions.

In Strawberry Jam, high advanced levels and mid expert levels seem to span a wider range of difficulties than other difficulty levels. A technique called "ultras" start to appear in high expert levels in Spring Collab but mid expert levels in Strawberry Jam. Also, some players consider Temporal Tower (high grandmaster level in Spring Collab) to be low grandmaster today, and Heart of the Storm to be mid grandmaster today. These are the intuitions behind my opinion.
